# machine-learning-housing-project
Machine learning and data analysis project to understand and predict home prices in Ames, Iowaâ€” by Charles Phillips, Nicole Wang, Robert Sandberg, and Tony Park

Machine Learning project where we analyze factors that contribute to housing prices. 

We performed Exploratory Data Analysis and conducted a case study for an Iowa State University professor looking to purchase a home.

We employed various Machine Learning Models such as Linear Regression, Penalized Regression, and Tree-based Models to predict housing prices.

Lasso Linear Regression and Gradient Boosting were the best performing models, with test scores above 0.90.

Future work would include making an app that takes in user input to find a suitable home to their specifications and more detailed analyses into specific features of the dataset.
